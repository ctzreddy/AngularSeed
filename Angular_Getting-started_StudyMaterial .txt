Angular setup:
install nodejs
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm start my-demo

Angular project structure:
---------------------------
e2e: End to end testing
node_modules: Third party modules that are defined in package.json
src: Main project application folder where all the stuff resides
.angular-cli.json: Configuration for Angular CLI. In this file you can set several defaults and also configure what files are included when your project is built
.editorconfig: Simple configuration for your editor to make sure everyone that uses your project has the same basic configuration
.gitignore: Git configuration to make sure autogenerated files are not commited to source control.
karma.conf.js: Unit test configuration
package.json: npm configuration listing the third party packages your project uses
protractor.conf.js: End-to-end test configuration
tsconfig.json: TypeScript compiler configuration
tslint.json: Linting configuration for TSLint together with Codelyzer

Inside src folder:
----------------------
app: Your app source code
assets: A folder where you can put images and anything
environments: This folder contains one file for each of your destination environments
favicon.ico: Just an angular icon
index.html: The Main HTML page that is served when someone visits the site
main.ts: The main entry point for your app. Compiles the application with the JIT compiler and bootstraps the application's root module (AppModule) to run in the browser
polyfills.ts: Different browsers have different levels of support of the web standards. Polyfills help normalize those differences
styles.css: Your global styles go here.
test.ts: This is the main entry point for your unit tests

Inside the app folder:
-----------------------
app.module.ts: (The application whole module where all the components exists). Defines AppModule, the root module that tells Angular how to assemble the application. Right now it declares only the AppComponent. Soon there will be more components to declare

app.component.css:
app.component.html:
app.component.spec.ts:(unit test) : (All the app components)Defines the AppComponent along with an HTML template, CSS stylesheet, and a unit test. It is the root component of what will become a tree of nested components as the application evolves
app.component.ts:
